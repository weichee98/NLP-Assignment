I was so impressed with everything:

The moves- JLO danced during the entire performance. No wonder she's in great shape! 

The voice- I don't recall her voice being as beautiful as when I saw her live. I think it's gotten better over time. 

The costumes: When Vegas meets JLo, you'll get sexy, sparkly, colorful outfits from head to toe... although some outfits barely cover anything at all!

The set: The stage, sound, lighting, and production were beautiful and flawless... It looked like there were a couple million bucks flying around making every song feel more magical and making JLo look hotter than ever. 

Our seats were $200 and were worth every penny. She sang all her hits, not in chronological order, but according to her different styles. She went from Brooklyn street swag to Puerto Rican Diva, to beautiful mother of her two Coconuts. I loved every minute of it, especially because photography was allowed!

Outside of the concert hall, you can check out her costumes including THE GREEN DRESS she wore to the Grammys in 2000 by Donatella Versace.",6/6/2017 20:03

JLo mixed in a lot of her oldies with some new tracks and even threw in a little Lee Ann Womack's ""i hope you dance"". lots of costume changes and obviously, lots of amazing choreography. light show was not too gawdy and crowd was really dialed in. overall, worth the $$$.",15/1/2017 4:13
bf5rYklEvLM9Q-EwuYCUjw,1MFocTYG0wD0-jklXhTjkg,_2X_W0Tf5-RXyGabxVwiGg,2,0,0,0,"I attended this show last night and was under the impression that it would have more of a concert appeal than the typical Vegas show. I've seen JLO in concert twice and was looking forward to a more personal experience with my friend who accompanied me. However, this was not the case. The crowd was BORING. I understand that not everyone is a huge JLO fan, but I really wish they would've considered those who are. IT IS A CONCERT! People are entitled to stand, dance, and sing, when they have paid money to enjoy their time. My friend and I were in section 103 and a few rows behind the VIP section. I was one of the few who were standing and was told three times to sit, one woman grabbed on my arm twice to make me sit, and another even smacked my backside; apparently hoping this would make me sit. 

That was the final straw. I had been playing nice and even ignored the first attempts to keep me seated, but after being hit in a more than personal area by a complete stranger, I decided I couldn't take the harassment any longer. I was willing to forfeit my tickets just to avoid a situation from progressing to something worse. I alerted security who confirmed for me that dancing IS allowed and thankfully allowed my friend and I to change seats. They were not nearly as good as the seats we had, but I was grateful to finish the show without any further disturbance. To say the least, I didn't enjoy my time; especially because my trip to Vegas was FOR JLO and my birthday. Unless you're able to attend this show/concert willing to pay for 6 tickets at VIP table, beware of the crowd.  

5 stars for JLO! She is a dedicated performer and has endless energy that unfortunately didn't rub off on the drab crowd. The costumes, lighting, music, choreography, dancers...etc was fantastic! I absolutely love her and plan on attending again in the future at a VIP table.",19/2/2017 18:56

The show started at 9:30 and it was amazing from start to  finish jlo looked right me and my daughter multiple times smiled and had so much contact with all the people .

But I must say that I absolutely loved this show. It was very well executed. The production was amazing. The lights were beautiful and the show had a true progression to it. She starts off with her earliest hits like love don't cost a thing and goes on to her time in the Bronx singing Jenny from the block, I'm real etc then to the newest and latest hits. 

Jlo dances her ass off in this show. Literally she dances to every single song. I don't know how she does it. She does this very sexy striptease too that makes me so jealous of her booty and her moves. She likes to be know as the hardest working singer out there and I must give her lots of credit. 

It was a thoroughly enjoyable night from start to end. The show is long too. About 2 hours. If you get a chance to go don't miss out!",3/7/2016 21:17

I am not a huge fan but I do love her acting so I went. The show blew me away! J.Lo is an amazing performer. She danced from start to finish. Just as the show is titled she gives it all she has!

The venue was not good for a showcase big time dancer like her. There were no screens with this large of a venue which makes it hard to see anything unless you have super close seats. I suggest if you go, bring binoculars or get seats in the center close to the stage. I did enjoy the lobby of jlos clothes. This is a venue I would never go to again in order to be able to see and enjoy a concert. Super sad. I hope her team realizes this and  understands. Love to Jlo and her team",26/9/2018 8:13

We had a really goodtime and so did the majority of fans!!! It was kinda sad to see a bunch of stuffy people there just sitting there not participating and looking bored. How could u not get up and want to dance?Don't know why they even bothered to go...  maybe they thought they were going to a taping of American idol?and cheapest seats were $139 not including service fees? If you are not a fan of her music...don't waste your money and let the real fans who appreciate the music and dancing buy the tickets and let JLo know that they appreciate her hard work!,21/9/2017 16:56

From the intro to the outro- J Lo aimed to please. Guess what party people? She did! She sang all the hits, danced, gyrated and popped her way through an awesome concert.


Just so you all know, people will get up and dance. IT IS A CONCERT!  I was not the first to get up but I was certainly not going to miss all of the choreography because the people in front of me were on their feet. I am 5 foot and some small change so I will get up on my toes and jam to the beat when I need to.

She encourages everyone in the audience to stand up however you can't see after that. I spent my night trying to catch a glimpse through people's shoulders.  They need to add video screens.  

This is not a concert and don't expect one. This is a true Vegas show. She has many costume changes and alot of filler time with other dancers.  She also talks to the audience alot and sings songs that aren't hers. At one point, the lady sitting behind me said ""get on with the show"" and I agree.  

The band and dancers were amazing. The show wasn't bad but for the price I expected to be able to see the show and be blown away. Neither happened.  If I had to plan the trip over again, I would have saved the money and skipped it.",15/9/2018 22:26

I'm someone that has seen quite a few concerts and there's nothing I like more than attending to see someone who truly gives it ""all they have"" on the stage, no pun intended. But this woman did exactly that and more. I danced the entire time, felt the nostalgia of her music through the years and the feels when intended too. The place isn't too big so there is no wrong seating in my opinion. It's honestly two hours of pure magic both visually and musically. Not to mention that they have a dress display in the lobby that you can't help but be mesmerized by as well. So it's a little nice fun before the fun type of deal. Also, they have great margaritas, just saying hehe. My questions is, what are you doing just sitting there reading my review? Go get your ticket and go see this beautiful legend do her thing!

Although our seats (Section 207 - P) was to far for the price we paid at VEGAS.COM that we couldn't enjoy the show as much as we wanted too. It's like we could hear her sing but that's pretty much it. 

Watching it on U TUBE probably was way better then our seats. 

But this is not to bring J LO down at all it's the seats  that made me not enjoy the experience but J LO you are amazing!

Lots of fun costume changes, lots of confetti, lots of fun!!  Her back up dancers were also GREAT dancers and good eye candy :)  I liked that she interacted with the audience so it felt like a small concert not a mega concert at a football stadium.

We splurged and got VIP tickets which came with a bottle of champs half way thru the show.  We got a private area with sofa style seating, and lots of room to move as well as a waitress that would take your drink orders.

Two hours of non-stop entertainment; fun, sweet, amazing. As for her dancers...first class!!! And she showed appreciation for them, too. They seem to adore her, along with her back up singers...excellent! Her connection with the audience was authentic. She loves her kids. The show was just fabulous! I would see it again and again!

But she was darling -- energetic, smart, funny, sexy, talented, and that dancing, she's truly an amazing, mesmerizing dancer. Her song for her kids was very touching (""I Hope You Dance""), and even her cover of Aretha's ""Respect"" was great. I left feeling like jumping and dancing and taking a little better care of my fabulous self a la J Lo style.   I'd definitely recommend paying a couple of extra bucks and getting a mid-theater seat, because everybody stands for a lot of the show and you really do want to see her.

Dance routines were great but repetitive during each number.   Sound system was way too loud (had to stuff ears with tissue) and at one point gave out completely.   Jlo sings well but not great.  Voice suited for pop but not for intimate softer songs.   Too much chatter about her children and motherhood (feeling guilty!) Left early. If I could have asked for a refund......,8/6/2017 14:48

Couldn't wait to see her, planned a long weekend w/8 fans.    Bought tickets way in advance through stub hub, they  were $200. $100 over face value.
These seats we're center but far back.  Hard to believe they can get away charging so much!
Needless to say we were way back but this is not a large venue.  Her performance on her hit songs was good, her dancing amazing but there was no monitors so we couldn't really see her, her slow songs did not sound good.  Huge disappointment for all in group as we were so excited to see our idol.  Have never gone to a concert that doesn't have monitors.

XWbrRpql8za4vzAdN774Ww,Cv0dv6cDvHE99fZ1thwADg,_2X_W0Tf5-RXyGabxVwiGg,2,2,0,0,"I'm going to disclose that my 2 star review is generated from me rating my experience watching the show as a full dynamic (J-lo's music selection, stage visuals, the pace of the show, choreography, the venue, the merchandise..etc).    I want to also disclose that I'm a casual Jennifer Lopez fan--I've just heard the songs that have made it to the radio--so I'm not a hardcore fanatic.    With that being said--here is my review

J-Lo is obviously a very hard working and talented woman.  It was obvious that she really takes her job seriously and she puts a ton of effort into her show.   Her dancing is amazing.  The stage visuals are also really cool--sometimes there is soo much going on that there is a bit of sensory overload---but this is Las Vegas--so I'm going to say that the visuals were also great.   I wasn't super aware of a lot of the songs that she sang---but most were pretty good.   I did feel like there was a lot of ""dead"" time that was occupied by ""filler"".   J-Lo did go through a lot of outfit changes and intricate set changes take time--so there were moments that to me seemed like random filler to accommodate for these time consuming events.   Also--I'd probably say that a good 15-20 minutes of the show was consumed by J-Lo trying to make dialogue with the audience--but I find that there was some disconnection there.   I personally found the show to be a bit repetitive and maybe 20 minutes too long. 

The reason why I have to give this show 2 stars is factoring in the cost of the tickets versus the quality of the venue the show was housed in.  I got tickets to see the show with my GF. We had decent seats--towards the front of section 204--which is just slightly off of pure center--towards the front of the back section.   The narrowness of the rows where the seats are is laughable at best. Every time a person needed to walk in or out of their seats--we literally had to all get up out of our seats--walk out to the major aisle to allow somebody pass--and then get re-seated.   I paid nearly $600 for the 2 seats that I got---and for that kind of money--I would highly expect to have seats that have more leg room than coach tickets on an airline would have.  It was beyond ridiculous.  If was obvious that they put waay too many rows of seats in the venue to maximize how many people they can pack into the venue---like sardines.   Because there are soo many rows of seats in this smaller venue--the problem is that the alleged ""stadium"" seating did absolutely nothing.  If the angle of the rise between the seats is small--there needs to be space between the rows so that your view is not obstructed by the heads of the people in front of you. Well at this venue--the angle of the stadium seating is very small--and the rows are soo close together that you will almost certainly be battling for a view. Heck--I'm 6 foot 2--and my view was obstructed!!   If this venue was better--and the seating not ridiculously bad--I would have given this show 4+ stars.  For the price they are charging for these tickets--it's even more insulting.    In conclusion--J-Lo did a great job. Bravo to her.   Boo to the Planet Hollywood for not giving this show the venue it deserves.",11/2/2017 16:47

I ate it walking down the stairs to the theater (no alcohol in my system yet I promise) and no one helped me...not even the staff. 

My seat was easy to find and there are ushers and security all around to make the process easier. At the start of the show they said no one could stand up. But then J.Lo said everyone could stand up and dance if they wanted to. I feel like unless you're at the front...you shouldn't be able to stand. My knee was bleeding and so I felt better sitting. But the people in front of me were having a blast and decided to stand for half the show....so I couldn't really see anything. The people behind me felt the same and tried to sit on the aisle steps...but were prompted to return to their seats. 

I enjoyed all the costumes and flashy lights; the sets were pretty cool but I feel like it could potentially be better? The time between the set changes took a while and she talked a lot of the time. 

I love J.Lo's music but she also sang covers...which was kind of weird to me.

I liked that there weren't a ton of special effects. She had about 8 outfit changes & did bits from most of her well known hits. Great dancers with her. I thought she was beautiful. Parts of it got racier than i expected which I wouldn't classify as family friendly (not for my 2 young daughters, while I respect her choices & hey, if I had the body! Lol who knows) but then she countered that with a heartfelt tribute to her babies which i can relate to as I missed mine while on vacation. She danced NONSTOP. Very athletic.

After the first 30 minutes she lost me. It was one of the worst shows we've seen. Living here in Las Vegas we see a lot of show and this by far was the worst. Seat were great. JLO can dance that women can move she's beautiful. But she's going to do a full Madonna seen basically air humping on a chair totally classless and then sing a son about respect? I don't get it. She started off very classy, a little sexy but still respectful. Her songs were amazing and she was awesome then the chair scene she never got us back in her show. I'm not that old still in my 30s I'll dress sexy to go out. I guess I just expected more class from her. When she did the chair scene she wasn't even singing it was just music in the background. I thought my husband would have loved but even for him he never got back into it. I just expected so much more from JLO had she been up dancing instead of almost naked humping the air it waited have been awesome. Not sure why she feels at her age and her success and being a mom she had to do that. That's just my opinion on the show. We will not be going back. I've seen Mariah 3 times Britney 2 NKOTB 2 and many others but 1 JLO was more than enough.",9/6/2017 18:38
